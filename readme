How to use Grok filter
In order to extract the fields we want to use, we need to use the Grok filter. Please refer to the "logstash.conf" file for our current filters.
Here is the instruction of Grok filter syntax.
To test whether your filter is working or not, use the Grok debugger (https://grokdebug.herokuapp.com/). You can also find this debugger in Kibana -> Dev tools -> Grok debugger.
There are predifined Grok patterns you can use, please refer to this Github repo.
